        The drive up to <a href="https://www.skicooper.com/" target="_blank">Ski Cooper</a> on the first Friday of February was one of those quintessential Colorado mornings—clear blue skies, crisp mountain air, and a promise of significant snow in the forecast following a 4-week long snow drought. As we wound our way along Hwy. 24 from Leadville to the base of Cooper Hill, I just knew we were going to have a fantastic day on the slopes.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the entrance to the ski area is the monument honoring the troops of the <a href="https://10thmtndivdesc.org/" target="_blank">10th Mountain Division</a>. The terrain we were about to ski would be "Legen.. (Wait for it).. DARY!”
      </p>
      <p>
      We easily found a parking spot that was both convenient to the entry area, close to the Tennessee Pass Nordic Center at the Cookhouse, and, oh yeah, free. 
      </p>
      <p>That’s right… free parking.</p>
      <p>For those who haven’t experienced Ski Cooper, this hidden gem 10 miles outside of Leadville, Colorado, is the opposite of the mega-resorts. No massive crowds, no endless lift lines—just wide-open runs, <a href="https://www.skicooper.com/cooper-day-pass/" target="_blank">affordable lift tickets</a> (adult tickets range from $45 for weekday non-holiday to $110 during peak periods), and a vibe that feels like the good old days, reminiscent of pulling into a less developed <a href="https://skivermont.com/" target="_blank">Vermont ski area</a>.</p>
      <p>Our where-to-go hunch played out. Even though Colorado hadn’t seen new snow in several weeks, <a href="https://snocountry.com/snow-report/colorado/cooper-chicago-ridge/" target="_blank">Ski Cooper’s snow base</a> and surface quality were exceptional, owing to fewer crowds and their remote location away from the frenzied I-70 corridor. </p>

      <h2 class="inline-title margin-top-20">Skiing Groomers, Powder, and Hidden Gems</h2>
      <img class="section-image" src="/assets/images/mountain-life/travel/ski-cooper/Ski-Cooper-Groomers.jpg" alt="A skier in the glades at Ski Cooper Colorado" />

      <p class="margin-top-10">
Once on the slopes we found groomer heaven. We headed up the 10th Mountain double chair, named to honor the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10th_Mountain_Division" target="_blank">WWII U.S. Army Division</a>, arcing our first few runs down Trail’s End, Homestake and Black Powder. Each was groomed to perfection—flawless, wide-open corduroy that tempted my inner afterburners. One of my favorite things about Cooper’s terrain is the intermediate runs feel rewarding, with plenty of space to let your skis run. Next, the Piney Basin triple chair delivered us to Ambush and Burnout, some great rolling blues, and without any of the congestion you find at bigger resorts, we could take our time dialing in turns as we dialed up the pace.
      </p>
      <p>
        The real highlight of the morning? First tracks on Timberbash—a lesser-known black diamond that had seen just enough Colorado sunshine to soften up the snow crystals. Cooper may not be known for extreme terrain, but with the right conditions, the tree runs here can be an absolute blast.

    <h2 class="inline-title margin-top-20">Exploring Steeper Terrain and Glades at Tennessee Creek Basin</h2>
    <img class="section-image" src="/assets/images/mountain-life/travel/ski-cooper/Ski-Cooper-Glades.jpg" alt="A skier in the glades at Ski Cooper Colorado" />

      <p class="margin-top-10">
        By noon, the temperature had crept into the upper 30s—softening up the steeps in Tennessee Creek Basin. We set our sights on single-diamond Slider and then double-diamond Viper that flanks Maverick to complete the Top Gun theme. Cooper’s double-black terrain is dotted with towering Lodgepole pine glades, the basis of the blue, green and white palette surrounding you. Further down the ridge, the shorter diamond chutes on the east side of the mountain spill you out onto Low Road, taking you to the bottom of the Little Horse T-bar.  It’s well worth pausing a few beats here to gaze up Chicago Ridge across the drainage from the bottom of Tennessee Creek Basin. Plans are being made to expand ski and snowboard terrain on Chicago Ridge. 
      </p>
      <p>While riding up the T-bar we made a plan to try Dancing Bears, a gladed run that dives off Motherlode; a similar pitch, thankfully shorter to ease our fiery legs. The runs here offer an aspect with really good snow cover and smaller bumps. Unlike many expert-only areas, Tennessee Creek Basin doesn’t require a long traverse or hike—it’s just pure, direct fall-line skiing.</p>

      <h2 class="inline-title margin-top-20">Ski Cooper’s Laid-back and Local Après-Ski</h2>
      <img class="section-image" src="/assets/images/mountain-life/travel/ski-cooper/Ski-Cooper-Apres-Ski.jpg" alt="The Timberline Taproom at the base of Ski Cooper Colorado" />
      <p class="margin-top-10">
        By late afternoon, our legs were beginning to feel the day, so we wrapped it up with a cruiser down 10th Mountain, a nod to the resort’s history as a training ground for WWII soldiers at nearby Camp Hale. It’s hard not to appreciate the history, deeply embedded in Cooper's culture.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.skicooper.com/eat-at-cooper/" target="_blank">Après-ski at Ski Cooper</a> is simple but satisfying. We landed in the Timberline Taproom at the base, grabbed a Colorado craft beer and chatted it up with Dean, our welcoming host. He recommended the smoked brisket chili, a hearty choice that did not disappoint. We compared our day with fellow skiers who all seemed to share the same sentiment: Cooper defines skiing the way it should be—affordable, fun, and refreshingly unpretentious.
      </p>
      <p>
        We packed our gear into our 4Runner and as we headed back toward Leadville on CO Highway 24, I couldn’t help but smile. Ski Cooper delivered yet another perfect day, proving once again why it remains one of Colorado’s best-kept secrets.
