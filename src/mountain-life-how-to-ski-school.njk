  </section>
  
  <section>
    <div class="block">
      <h2 class="inline-title margin-top-20">Dynamic Skiing and Riding</h2>
      <img class="section-image" src="/assets/images/mountain-life/how-to/ski-school-killington-k1-gondola.jpg" alt="View from the top of Killington’s K1 gondola with a double black diamond trail sign" />

      <p class="margin-top-10">
        Dynamic skiing and riding techniques are essential for navigating a variety of terrain, from wide-open groomers to glades and variable conditions. On steeper slopes, uneven terrain, or changing snow conditions, the ability to adjust movements on the fly ensures stability and more control.      
      </p>
      <p class="m-b-0">
          Lessons will focus on:
      </p>
      <ul class="mountain-life-list">
        <li><strong>Edge Pressure Control</strong> - Learning how to gradually engage and release your edges for smoother, controlled turns, especially on firm snow or mixed conditions. </li>
        <li><strong>Stance Adjustments</strong> - Adapting body position dynamically to terrain changes, improving balance and agility in everything from groomed runs to soft powder.</li>
        <li><strong>Terrain Utilization</strong> - Using natural features like rollers and banks to generate speed and flow without excessive effort, making it easier to navigate changing terrain.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <div class="block">
      <h2 class="inline-title margin-top-20">Riding Switch</h2>
      <p class="margin-top-10">
        For snowboarders and even some skiers, riding switch—going downhill with your non-dominant foot forward or backward on skis—adds versatility and balance. Advanced instruction will help you develop proper edge control and confidence to ride switch in different conditions, whether in the terrain park or on varying terrain.
      </p>
      <p class="m-b-0">
          Instructors focus on:
      </p>
      <ul class="mountain-life-list">
        <li><strong>Edge Transitions </strong>– Learning how to smoothly shift between edges while riding switch, crucial for maintaining control.</li>
        <li><strong>Body Alignment </strong>– Adjusting weight distribution to maintain a centered, stable stance, which helps in uneven terrain, landing switch off jumps or transitioning between turns.</li>
        <li><strong>Switch Carving</strong> – Developing the ability to carve turns while riding switch to maintain fluidity and speed, especially useful for park riding.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <div class="block">
      <h2 class="inline-title margin-top-20">Carving</h2>
      <img class="section-image" src="/assets/images/mountain-life/how-to/ski-school-carving.jpg" alt="A snowboarder laying down a carved turn" />
      <p class="margin-top-10">
        Carving is a key skill for advanced skiers and riders who want to achieve clean, precise turns. Lessons will teach you how to properly engage your edges, control speed, and maximize efficiency while maintaining stability.
      </p>
      <p class="m-b-0">
          Lessons emphasize:
      </p>
      <ul class="mountain-life-list">
        <li><strong>Edge Engagement</strong> – Properly setting edges to create deep, controlled arcs, crucial for racing or aggressive skiing and riding.</li>
        <li><strong>Hip Angulation</strong> – Learning to tilt the body at the right angles to help maintain grip and reduce skidding, particularly important for maintaining control on steeper terrain.</li>
        <li><strong>Speed Control</strong> – Using the shape of the turn to control speed rather than relying on skidding or braking.</li>
      </ul>
      
    </div>
  </section>
  
  <section>
