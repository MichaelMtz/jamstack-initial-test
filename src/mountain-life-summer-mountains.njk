        hen you think of Arapahoe Basin, Sunday River, or Mammoth Mountain, snow-capped peaks and ski slopes come quickly to mind. But have you heard birdsong from the chairlift or noticed how the white-blanketed horizon takes on a lush green quilt in the warmer weather? The same combination of peaceful nature and adrenaline-pumping adventure that draws us to the mountains in the winter continues to call when the days are long. These majestic landscapes transform into vibrant playgrounds, offering a wealth of activities for families and adults alike. The allure of the mountains in summer is undeniable – from the crisp, clean air to pristine mountain lakes; the stunning vistas and the smorgasbord of outdoor adventures ready for your visit.

      <p class="margin-top-10">
      Perhaps it's the escape from the sweltering heat of the cities, with the temps dropping as elevation climbs. Or we could be drawn by the chance to reconnect with nature in its most awe-inspiring form, lingering much longer than when sub-freezing temps drive us back to the fireplace. Mountains in the summer offer a unique combination of tranquility and excitement, making them an ideal destination for both relaxation and adventure.

        iking is the most quintessential summer mountain activity. Trails range from easy walks suitable for families to challenging treks for experienced hikers. Try your hand at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jacksonhole.com/summer-activities/via-ferrata">Via Ferrata at Jackson Hole</a> or hike sections of the famous Appalachian Trail over Saddleback, Sugarloaf, and throughout Vermont and New Hampshire. The rewarding lake and mountain views from summits like Whitefish Mountain Resort in Montana are truly breathtaking, and you might spot wildlife such as moose, black bears, or various bird species along the way.    </p>

      <p class="margin-top-10">
        New to mountain hiking? Hike like a local. Your green rated trail in the winter will be steeper in the summer.  Most resort areas and regions ride a little differently in the summer. Trail hiking maps are either printed or available online. And pay attention to your cell signal! Hiking traffic can be significantly less than winter in case you need to call for help. If you go alone – tell someone and remember to pack plenty of trail mix and water.

      or the gravity junkies seeking an adrenaline rush, mountain biking is a thrilling way to explore. Many ski resorts zig-zag their slopes with a mountain bike park during summer. Bike racks mounted to chairlifts haul bikers and their trusty steeds to save the grueling vertical climb. In Vermont, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.killington.com/things-to-do/activities/bike-park">Killington Resort’s Bike Park</a> boasts over 30 miles of  trails, catering to all skill levels. Cross-country riders can enjoy scenic paths through forests and meadows, while downhill enthusiasts can test their skills on challenging descents. You’ll quickly recognize the green-blue-black trail rating system, but you will need more than a few glances to wrap your mind around the new map on a familiar mountain.

any resorts now feature adventure centers that offer a variety of exciting activities. A far cry from the base lodge experience you remember in January, yard games, summer concerts, and all kinds of activities invite you to spend a few hours in far fewer layers.

      <p class="margin-top-10">
        For a bird's-eye view of the forest canopy, try ziplining or a ropes course. Challenge yourself while enjoying unique perspectives of the mountain environment. Sunday River Resort in Maine offers canopy tours that combine ziplining with sky bridges for an unforgettable treetop adventure.

        A mountain coaster combines the thrill of a roller coaster with the beauty of the natural landscape. Riders control their speed as they zip through twists and turns down the mountainside. The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.aspensnowmass.com/visit/activities/summer/lost-forest/breathtaker-alpine-coaster">Breathtaker Alpine Coaster at Aspen Snowmass</a> hits speeds up to 28 mph in almost 10 minutes of continuous descent.

        or a more relaxed mountain experience, scenic chairlift or gondola rides offer panoramic views without the physical exertion. Keep an eye out for wildlife as you ascend to the summit. The Tram at Jackson Hole will amaze you with views far out to the horizon and a peek at what lies beneath our planks. Hard to imagine all that sliding over all those rocks!

        vacation in the mountains is a delight any time of year, and the summer is no exception. The cooler temperatures provide relief from summer heat, while the clean mountain air is invigorating and refreshing. The physical activity, exposure to nature, and break from daily stressors can all contribute to improved mood and well-being so you pretty much have a doctor’s note to skip work and skip into the forest right? The mountains offer a chance to disconnect from technology (the wifi and reception aren’t really that much better in the summer) and reconnect with the natural world. That’s what summer’s all about! Whether you're solo hiking to a summit, racing your buddies down a rugged mountain singletrack, or simply enjoying the view from a chairlift telling your kiddo all about their first ski winter coming up, the mountains provide unforgettable experiences and a chance to create lasting memories.

        So why not discover the magic of summer in the mountains for yourself?
